# Books and Papers
Must-read books and papers for developers

## Books

### Essentials
These are the essentials; any first-year junior developer should have read them:

- [Thomas & Hunt, The Pragmatic Programmer](https://www.amazon.de/Pragmatic-Programmer-journey-mastery-Anniversary/dp/0135957052/):
Probably the first book anyone should read. Lots of solid advice on how to become a professional software developer who gets stuff done.
- [Martin, Clean Code](https://www.amazon.de/Robert-Martin/dp/):
Writing code so that not only the compiler understands it. Essential practices that will shape your own style and required reading in many development organizations.
- [Bloch, Effective Java](https://www.amazon.de/Effective-Java-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997/):
If you're programming Java, you have to read this book. Best Practices on how to use the language by Josh Bloch, who designed many features in modern Java.

### Advanced Topics
Pick and choose depending what you need and/or are interested in:

- [Gamma et al, Design Patterns. Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.de/Erich-Gamma/dp/0201633612/):
An old book, but still the definitive reference on design patterns (when first reading it, pick the top 10 patterns, don't read it cover to cover). Alternatively, you can read - [Head First Design Patterns]():, which is easier, twice as long, and doesn't cover as many patterns.
- [Goetz, Java Concurrency in Practice](https://www.amazon.de/Java-Concurrency-Practice-Brian-Goetz/dp/0321349601/):
Anyone who builds Java services needs a basic understanding of concurrency. If you haven't read the book, you will most likely have already introduced concurrency bugs.
- [Nygard, Release It! Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software](https://www.amazon.de/Release-Design-Deploy-Production-Ready-Software/dp/1680502395/):
Best practices for delivering robust software that doesn't fail in the production environment.
- [Fowler, UML Distilled: A Brief Guide to the Standard Object Modeling Language](https://www.amazon.de/UML-Distilled-Standard-Addison-wesley-Technology/dp/0321193687/):
Learn how to use UML in a pragmatic way. This very short book covers everything you ever need to know on the subject.
- [Fowler, Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](https://www.amazon.de/Martin-Fowler/dp/0321127420/)
- [Grikorik, High Performance Browser Networking](https://hpbn.co/):
This online book covers networking in general (not just browser-based) and gives you all the basics you'd typically learn in a two-semester networking course.
- [Evans, Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software](https://www.amazon.de/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215/):
How to model your business domain in alignment with your business stakeholders. One of the most influential books in software design to date.
- [Hohpe, Woolf: Enterprise Integration Patterns: Designing, Building, and Deploying Messaging Solutions](https://www.amazon.de/Enterprise-Integration-Patterns-Designing-Deploying/dp/0321200683): Enterprise Integration Patterns provides an invaluable catalog of sixty-five patterns, with real-world solutions that demonstrate the formidable of messaging and help you to design effective messaging solutions for your enterprise.
